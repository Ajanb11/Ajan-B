📚 Learning Journey

I started coding because I was curious about how games and websites are built.
At first, I experimented with simple HTML and CSS pages. Over time, I added JavaScript, which opened the door to interactive apps and games.

Today, I’m proud to say that I’ve built:

Fully styled websites

Interactive map games

Memory match challenges

Creative experiments with gradients, animations, and UI effects

And I’m still learning more every day 🚀

🧩 Fun Facts About Me

🎮 Favorite projects are always games — I love building something that’s fun and playable.

🦷 One of my websites is dedicated to my dentist (yes, really 😅).

🌍 I enjoy making educational projects like maps and wonders of the world.

🎨 I like my apps to look like modern mobile apps with gradients and neon colors.

⚡ I’m not afraid of big projects — I’ve built games with 1000+ lines of code in a single file.
